==================

Pre-built containers with demo-fast-cs and its dependencies already

Starting the container
----------------------

To pull the container from github container registry and run::

    $ docker run ghcr.io/DiamondLightSource/demo-fast-cs:main --version

To get a released version, use a numbered release instead of ``main``.
